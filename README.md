# port_scan / perl script
Scans common server ports 
================================================================================================
Step 1 Create a file called myhosts.txt and add your server name / ip address in it, copy this file into the same folder as the perl script.

Step 2 Run the perl script, it should ping the server and scan through the common ports in the script, the output should look something like the below. 

Note:There should also be a few text files in the folder, these contain details of the scan. With a few lines of code, you scan your device easily.  

Scan Example:

Port: 20 on 192.168.0.1 is closed.
Port: 21 on 192.168.0.1 is closed.
Port: 22 on 192.168.0.1 is closed.
Port: 23 on 192.168.0.1 is closed.
Port: 25 on 192.168.0.1 is closed.
Port: 53 on 192.168.0.1 is closed.
Port: 80 on 192.168.0.1 is open.
